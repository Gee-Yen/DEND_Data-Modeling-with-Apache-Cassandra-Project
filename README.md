# Purpose:
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

The purpose of this project is to extract the data from the CSV files to the Apache Cassandra tables so that the analytics team can analyze the data of the modelled queries.

# Datasets:

**Event_data**: The directory of CSV files partitioned by date.

**sample file**:
